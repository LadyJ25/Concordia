Named after it's wealth and splendor, this fortress spans across many halls, caverns and living areas carved out of the mountain itself. Famed for being a stronghold able to withstand any assault, it's only weakness lies in the vast tunnel network, which some say led the dwarves to discover the drow city of Naggeroth.<br><br>In 2AR the kingdom was overrun by creatures from the Underdark via the Golgoroth Labyrinth, not to be retaken by the dwarves until 86AR.";

Though not officially a kingdom, Venosia is their largest settlement, home to most of the Venosian wild elves.<br><br>In 86AR the dwarves from Erdunar sought to reclaim their kingdom from the creatures of the Underdark that had come to claim the Golden Halls of Trondinar, but the Venosian elves did not allow them passage, erupting in a small war between dwarves and elves, gaining them the title wild elves. In the end the dwarves were victorious and cut a pass through the forest, and the wild elves of the Venosian Forest never forgot and never forgave. They have a strong disdain for dwarves, but are hostile to almost all passerby's, especially so when their kin in Lunasyll did not come to their aid, leaving them feeling betrayed.";

The finest craftsmen went to work beneath Mount Kinroyal, digging, crafting and reinforcing new halls beneath. The underground halls span across a large portion of the kingdom, with various cantons holding their own population and clans, but the main entrance lies here, leading to the Royal Canton of Erdunar, home to the royal family.";

Crafted from white stone, seemingly floating majestically upon Lake Lornar's waters, the city became the new nation's capital when Crysta's lands got divided and what was previously East-Crysta became Entarin, under the rule of it's own king. Home to the most noble and wealthiest of the kingdom, it is known to tax not only it's citizens, but also it's visitors to marvel at the city's splendor.";

Above the clouds the city has a serene and solitairy location and on a clear day one can see far across the eastern kingdoms. Arlathan can be accessed in two ways, through a path leading from the east up the mountain to it's peak or through a single magnificent hollowed tree, up a winding stairs known as the trial of 30.000 steps.";

At the city's highest point, the pinnacle of the city; the palace was built, home to the royal family of Crysta. The palace can be seen from every corner of the large city of Highwind, overseeing the city from above.<br><br>In 1200, on the night of the new year's celebration the city was overtaken by Drows, who disabled the sundials in the capital and took the city by surprise in one fell swoop. From thereon they created a perpetual magical darkness that spread from Highwind across the kingdom of Crysta, as the whole kingdom slowely but surely fell to the drows, now able to operate day and night under the cover of darkness.";

    var customPopup8 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Lighthaven.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Lighthaven, Capital of Draemor</b><br><i>Race: Humans<br>Founded: 712AR</i><br><br> The story of Lighthaven and Draemor is one of great darkness. The land got corrupted by darkness in 92AR, becoming dry and lifeless gradually. Crysta became divided and these lands came to be known as Draemor. Lighthaven was once a sanctuary for those with magical abilities, shunned in other towns and villages. When the corruption spread, a man named Mason Velenor, possessed by a demon named Lezziad created an army and attacked Crysta in 106AR in the first War of the Forsaken. After 7 years Draemor and the town of Lighthaven got barred off from the world through a magical dome permitting neither living, nor dead, nor even time itself passage. The barrier broke in 225AR, in which Lezziad led a second War of the Forsaken, but the same fate befell them a year thereafter.<br>It wasn't until 712AR when Lezziad planned his escape that a group of adventurers named Dane Mountainmane, Mas Murs'sstrea, Lucinda Attina and Catelyn Valen freed the guardian of the forest; Erisdar, from it's corruption, leading to the cleansing of Lighthaven and it's lands.";

After the first War of the Forsaken in 113AR, due it's remote location from Crysta's more populated lands, the gnomes pleaded to have these farmlands as their own. Crysta obliged and henceforth the lands came to be known as Kanto.<br>Essos, accessed through a valley is the capital of Kanto, home to it's King and it's citizens, who no longer tend farmlands, but rather shops, crafts and services.";

    var customPopup10 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Myrthana.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Myrthana, Capital of North-Mareen</b><br><i>Race: Merfolk (land-dwelling)<br>Founded: Before the Reckoning</i><br><br> Myrthana, the watercity crowned capital of North-Mareen, built elevated in the middle of a lake and uniquely accessable by water. Aquaducts with magical thrusting powers were built that allow ships to enter and exit Myrthana, laying anchor right at the heart of the city. Though the merfolk simply travel through the waters of Myrthana between it's buildings and districts, it's visitors are given the option to rent rowboats or simply travel through Myrthana's underwater glass tunnels leading to all buildings from below. <br><br>Known as one of the greatest trade cities with a magnificent hall dedicated to trade, Myrthana is a sight to behold.<br>It's greatest and unrelenting threats come from the east, the creatures from the Zenuvean Marshes and perhaps even more so from the south; from their own kin who judge them for their choice to dwell on land, rather as in the sea.";

    var customPopup11 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Zesqua.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Zesqua, Capital of South-Mareen</b><br><i>Race: Merfolk<br>Founded: 11AR</i><br><br> After Helix left his merfolk to live without his direct guidance, the merfolk could not shape as often anymore, which left with a choice of lifestyle; to live under the oceans waves or above. The merfolk that choose to live within the ocean left the riverlands of North-Mareen in 11AR and settled into underwater settlements and cities both majestic and impressive to behold. Zesqua became the merfolk of South-Mareen their capital, home to the King and his denizens. <br><br>Though they united in Zesqua and eventually the surrounding settlements, the merfolk of South-Mareen ever saw their kin in the north as a disgrace to their race; choosing to live on land with a pair of legs like any other, rather than with the unique gift Helix bestowed on them. Ever do they seek to bring North-Mareen under their own rule and force all merfolk to live the way they are supposed to. Though not all merfolk from South-Mareen support this standpoint, Zesqua has been known to act akin this belief.";

Nymh became home to the elven clans that sought more solitude and wanted to be closer to nature rather than the inhabitants of Ascentia and their political agendas.<br><br>The woods of Nymh are veiled in magic gifted by the last known unicorn roaming the woods, known as the Lady Amalthea. As long as she remains within the Nymh woods, they remain in a contiuous state of spring. Though magical, the woods are treacherous, lulling their visitors into a misguided feeling of safety, as they are home to a variety of wildlife, both harmless creatures and those that demand a certain respect.";

    var customPopup13 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Caelethon.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Caelethon, Capital of the Hashmal Kingdom</b><br><i>Race: Wild Elves<br>Founded: 677AR</i><br><br> To the north of Destrun lay the forested lands that the wild elves came to inhabit in 64AR after the clans came to a disagreement on how to venture forth with their laws and relations between the other kingdoms. Hashmal become home to a number of elves that choose a more martial and militant way of life over that of studies, wisdom and serene like their kin in Lunasyll and Nymh. They came to be known as Wild Elves, hostile to most others but to their own kin, defending their homelands with vigor from outsiders. <br><br> It wasn't until 677AR that Destrun officially gifted the Hashmal Elves their own kingdom, though they had occupied it for centuries already. This to gain their favor and alliance when the Eastern Kingdoms united.<br>In the heart of the Hashmal Woods lies Caelethon, which has a unique palace build within a great tree amidst a small ravine; one of the wild elves their finest architecture compared to their wild elven kin in the Venosian Forest and the Zenuvean Marches.";

    var customPopup14 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Lyss.jpg' height='200px', width='300px'/><br><b>Lyss, Capital of Destrun</b><br><i>Race: Humans/Mix<br>Founded: 39AR</i><br><br> Humans have always had a strong penchant for migration and as such small groups of people would leave their homelands in the west in the early ages to lay claim upon the eastern lands. Though it required fending off the original denizens of the sandy deserts of Destrun, they lay claim to the largest oasis of the land, comfortably lying in the shade of a mountainrange. Lyss was built around it and the deserts were claimed as a kingdom of their own called Destrun in 39AR. Though Lyss was claimed by humans, it does not discriminate and over the years the city became home to those of all races, it's leadership given to a council existing of at least one of most different races.<br><br> Though the eastern kingdoms pride themselves on their lawful and militant statures, Destrun and it's neighbouring kingdom Gandarra are more lax when it comes to laws and rules, realizing that a dose of illegality is profitable to the kingdom. Many illegal trade is done on it's black markets and this political behavior was to be halted when the western kingdoms united and extended their hand to Destrun and Gandarra. The east however, enjoying their lifestyle, did not want to be oppressed by the west and created their own alliance in 677AR between Destrun, Gandarra, the Hashmal Kingdom , Lir's Kingdom and a variety of more civil orc tribes in the Ishtari Wastes.";

    var customPopup15 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Zenuvea.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Zenuvea</b><br><i>Race: Wild Elves<br>Founded: 64AR</i><br><br>In the southern reaches of Ascentia, to the east of North-Mareen, the wild elves came to inhabit the Zenuvean Marches in 64AR after the clans came to a disagreement on how to venture forth with their laws and relations between the other kingdoms. Though not officially a kingdom, Zenuvea is their largest settlement, home to most of the Zenuvean wild elves.<br><br>The elves in the Zenuvean Marches are considered the most ‘wild’ of them all. They spend a great deal of their lives struggling for their existence, as the Zenuvean Marches bring many dangers, not only in the nature of lands, but also with the inhabitants the Zenuvean Elves share their marches with. These inhabitants range from Sirens in the lakes near Mareen to Lizard men who have a large number of settlements within the forest. It is for this reason however, these elves decided to settle down here, as they believe it only serves to hone their skills and senses.";

    var customPopup16 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Nebiros.jpg' height='300px', width='300px'/><br><b>Nebiros, Capital of Gandarra</b><br><i>Race: Humans/Mixed<br>Founded: 5AR; Independant since 58AR</i><br><br>Shortly after the Reckoning in 2AR, the people of Crysta sent a small force to the east, beyond the Crevice to erect a fortress bordering the Darkglimpse; a land treacherous and filled with dark and evil creatures. Believing the greatest evils of the land were still permitted to live in this distant land, the western kingdoms felt it was a neccesity to protect themselves from it. The fortress of Nebiros and it's great wall was build, to be a watchpost should any evil ever rise in those lands again.<br><br>Nebiros, so remote from the western kingdoms established a way of living on it's own, expanding and creating their own laws as other travellers made their home within the fortress. In 58AR Crysta gave Nebiros it's independant, granting them the fortress and the surrounding lands, which came to be known as the kingdom of Gandarra.<br><br> In 676AR, Gandarra, though keeping it's militant nature, had long distanced itself from the law-abiding society of the east, adopting a society more akin Destrun. When the alliances were made, Crysta and Entarin came to claim their outpost once again. The siege on Nebiros lasted 2 straight weeks, but the fortress did not fall. When Destrun's forces came to Gandarra's aid, the Western armies were routed and returned home unsuccessfull. A year later, in 677AR, Gandarra joined the eastern alliance, alongside Destrun, the Hashmal Kingdom , Lir's Kingdom and a variety of more civil orc tribes in the Ishtari Wastes.";

Eventually, though trying to coexist, the tiberians were forced to flee from their homeland to the northeast. The cold mountainous areas of Tiberia were home to a great wyrm named Shinryu, who punished the tiberians for stealing her eggs to survive the cold, tricking and cursing them and the land. Their bodies changed, turning more frost giant than human, though some survived their grim fate and full transformation to Sons of Shinryu thanks to the sacrifice of their chieftain.<br><br>Those sane came to call themselves Tiberians and their magically icy cold land Tiberia, a place so cold that even through magical means it is hard to travel through as anyone else but a Tiberian. Glacium was built in a mountainpass, carved half into the icy mountains, it's halls beneath shimmering with the beauty of sculpted ice, never thawing.";

    var customPopup18 = "<img src='Maps/Capitals/Parthorus.jpg' height='200px', width='300px'/><br><b>Parthorus, Capital of the Kingdom of the Iron Boot</b><br><i>Race: Mixed<br>Founded: 130AR</i><br><br>For a long time in the early ages and even before the Reckoning the east was near uninhabited. It was considered a savage land, as the Kingdom of the Iron Boot is largely jungles; dangerous places that a great many wild creatures call their home. Parthorus is a city at the southern coast one can reach safely by boat, circumventing the jungles and the uncharted lands to the north. It was Vincent Parthorus who first sailed here with a great many men and ships under his command. Rich as he was, from his noble line and illegal activities he was able to raise the city of Parthorus and called the lands his own in 130AR.<br><br> It is known to be a safe haven to pirates and the populace is largely pirates, sailors and those that wish to entertain these types. As their nature is, there is no law to be found in this city or the kingdom. It is a chaotic city, filled with those that will do as they please at all times. The only law that is being kept is that of honor towards the Captain who rules over the city. When this captain dies or likely meets some unfortunate fate on the seas or in the more lawful kingdoms, a new ‘Captain Parthorus’ is chosen through a Captain’s Moot, where a court of prominent pirate captains come together to decide through voting upon the new ‘Captain Parthorus’. In Vincent Parthorus’ honor the name was never changed.";

There is but one place that allows access to outsiders and has any law to it; the city of Durn. <br><br> Durn is a crudely made city, consisting largely of stone and large cloths risen on poles to serve as shelter for the sun. Durn is considered a prize-city and its iconic feature is the large arena within. This arena in the early ages served for the most distinguished fighters of the tribes to fight out battles to the death for the honor of their tribe. The last remaining fighter wins this honored tournament for his tribe and he - or another chosen by him - earns the title “High Chieftain” and may take up the throne in Durn. This tribe then rules Durn for 3 years and laws within the city are decided completely by the tribe that holds it for those years. The only law that is continual is that of no bloodshed within Durn’s walls. Those that draw blood of another within Durn are considered punishable by death - often done within the arena. Whether Orc, half-Orc or outsider makes no difference, the only one exempt of this rule is the High Chieftain himself.";

In 15AR he made a pact with a great demonic power who allowed him his desires of capturing the celestial creatures that roamed Ascentia named unicorns. Through the power of a demonic flaming red bull he trapped all but one in the seas beneath his palace. Due to this pact the lands withered, as did the man, but he did not die for centuries. He hunted the last unicorn for his collection with vigor. The demon in the end claimed Haggard's life, leaving the dry and dreary lands to Haggard's son; Lir - both of whom lived unnaturally long due to the unicorns their presence. Lir, the complete opposite of his father sought to refertilize the lands and make his kingdom flourish.<br><br>When he came in contact and fell in love with the Lady Amalthea from Nymh, his wishes come true as she helped him bring life back to his lands. Though she departed, Lir rules his land with kindness and peace, offering home to all creatures of nature. In the dry wastes of the east, it is considered to be a small paradise.";
